# Prompt Engineering Fundamentals

Effective prompt engineering is the art of crafting clear, specific instructions that guide AI models to produce desired outputs.

## Core Principles

### 1. Be Specific and Clear

Vague prompts yield vague results. Specify exactly what you want.

**Poor:**
```text
Write about hotels
```

**Better:**
```text
Write a 200-word description of a luxury beachfront hotel
highlighting amenities, location benefits, and target guests.
```

### 2. Provide Context

Give the AI relevant background information.

```text
Context: You're a hotel revenue manager analyzing Q4 2024 data.
Task: Identify 3 pricing optimization opportunities based on
current occupancy rates and competitor analysis.
```

### 3. Use Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)

Show the AI the desired output format.

```text
Create guest welcome messages following this style:

Example: "Welcome, Sarah! Your ocean-view suite on the 12th
floor awaits. Complimentary champagne is chilled and ready."

Now create one for: John, Presidential Suite, 20th floor,
business traveler.
```

### 4. Specify Format and Constraints

Define length, structure, and style requirements.

```text
Create a 3-bullet summary of our spa services:
- Each bullet max 15 words
- Focus on unique selling points
- Professional yet warm tone
```

## Prompt Structure Template

```text
Role: [Who the AI should be]
Context: [Relevant background]
Task: [What to do]
Format: [How to present it]
Constraints: [Limitations or requirements]
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Overloading**: Too many instructions confuse the model
- **Ambiguity**: Unclear expectations lead to inconsistent results
- **Missing context**: AI can't read your mindâ€”be explicit
- **No validation**: Always review and refine outputs

## Best Practices

1. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on results
2. **Test variations**: Small changes can significantly impact output
3. **Use delimiters**: Separate sections with `---` or `###`
4. **Specify tone**: Professional, casual, technical, friendly
