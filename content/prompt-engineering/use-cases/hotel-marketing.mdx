## ROI Metrics

**Content production acceleration:**
- Social posts: 3 hours → 20 minutes (per week)
- Email campaigns: 6 hours → 45 minutes
- Blog posts: 4 hours → 1 hour (draft stage)
- Ad copy testing: 2 hours → 15 minutes

**Quality maintained through:**
1. Brand guideline prompts
2. Human review and refinement
3. A/B testing for effectiveness
4. Continuous prompt iteration

## Common Pitfalls

- **Generic output**: Add specific property details to prompts
- **Inconsistent voice**: Include brand guidelines in every prompt
- **Forgetting CTAs**: Explicitly request calls-to-action
- **No localization**: Specify regional language variations

**AI accelerates creation; marketers ensure strategy and brand alignment.**
