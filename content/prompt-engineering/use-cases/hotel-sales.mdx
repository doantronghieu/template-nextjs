# Prompt Engineering for Hotel Sales

Leverage AI to streamline sales workflows and personalize client communications at scale.

## 1. Group Booking Proposals

### Prompt Template
```text
Role: Hotel sales manager
Context: Corporate client requesting 50 rooms for 3-night conference

Create a professional proposal including:
- Room block details (dates, room types, rates)
- Meeting space options (capacity, setup styles)
- F&B minimum requirements
- Concessions (comp rooms, WiFi, parking)
- Cancellation policy

Tone: Professional yet warm
Format: Structured sections with bullet points
```

### Output Example
Generated proposals with consistent formatting, ready for review and customization.

## 2. Follow-Up Email Sequences

### Prompt Template
```text
Create a 3-email follow-up sequence for a wedding inquiry:

Email 1 (Day 0): Enthusiastic introduction, venue highlights
Email 2 (Day 3): Address common wedding planning concerns
Email 3 (Day 7): Limited availability urgency, call-to-action

Each email:
- Max 150 words
- Personal, conversational tone
- Include specific venue benefits
- Clear next step
```

## 3. Objection Handling Scripts

### Prompt Template
```text
Client objection: "Your rates are higher than Competitor X"

Generate 3 response variations that:
- Acknowledge their concern
- Highlight our unique value (location, amenities, service)
- Provide cost-benefit comparison
- Offer compromise (package deal, added value)

Tone: Empathetic, solution-focused
```

## 4. RFP Response Generator

### Prompt Template
```text
RFP Details:
- Client: Tech startup, 200-person annual retreat
- Dates: June 15-18, 2025
- Requirements: [paste specific requirements]

Generate responses for:
1. Why we're the best fit (150 words)
2. Team building activity suggestions (5 options)
3. Dietary accommodation capabilities
4. AV tech and support offerings
```

## 5. Personalized Rate Quotes

### Prompt Template
```text
Client Profile:
- Type: Repeat corporate client
- History: 12 stays, avg 25 rooms/night
- Budget sensitivity: Moderate

Create a rate quote that:
- References their loyalty
- Offers tiered pricing (commitment-based)
- Includes value-adds (breakfast, late checkout)
- Positions premium options without pressure
```

## Best Practices

1. **Maintain brand voice**: Include your hotel's tone guidelines
2. **Use variables**: `[client_name]`, `[dates]` for easy customization
3. **Review before sending**: AI outputs need human verification
4. **A/B test**: Compare AI-generated vs. manual for effectiveness
5. **Iterate prompts**: Refine based on conversion rates

## Time Savings

- Proposal generation: 2 hours → 15 minutes
- Email sequences: 45 min → 5 minutes
- RFP responses: 4 hours → 30 minutes

**AI handles structure and content; you add the personal touch.**
